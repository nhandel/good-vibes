**Excellent work so far! Let's move to the next part of our plan: `.cursor/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc`**

Carefully review the the implementation plan to identify the **next incomplete step**. This will be the first step marked as 'Progress: Not Started', or 'Progress: In Progress' if you are resuming an interrupted step. You are to execute **only this single identified step**.

Follow the same steps as previously described. As a reminder:
1.  Understand Validation Criteria:` Fully grasp the step's validation requirements.
2.  Execute Actions:
    2.1.    Perform all plan actions (TDD, use Step 0 tests).
    2.2.    Run defined validations.
    2.3.    Address failures: analyze, attempt up to 3 fixes.
3. Update Context:
    3.1.    Update specified context documents.
    3.2.    Mark step progress as 'Completed'.
4. Report & Review: Provide a full report (changes, manual validation, confirmations).

**Remember, your focus is solely on this next step. Your continued success is critical to completing the implementation plan. Apply the next step with precision.**
